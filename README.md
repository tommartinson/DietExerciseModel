# Diet & Exercise Model

I created this tool as part of the final project for my modeling and simulation course. My health is very important to me and I believe it should be important to you as well. According to 2015-2016 CDC Data, the prevalence of obesity in the United States was 39.8% and affected about 93.3 million adults. I believe that one of the reasons why obesity has become such a big issue is because of the lack of knowledge on the best ways to stay fit and the best ways to prevent obesity, through both diet and exercise. This is why I created a tool simulate diet & exercise plans instantly. Therefore, providing the necessary information one needs to proceed on their journey to a healthy lifestyle. This tool takes in one's health, diet, and exercise information and simulates the corresponding diet and exercise plan over a specified period of time. It uses the Matplotlib Python library to create easy to read graphs showing one's change in weight.
